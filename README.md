# Noteblock helper
- Simple tool for noteblock pattern learning

## Features:
### Ordered selected blocks highlighter
- 4 keybinds:
- Add a block - adds a block to the ordered list
- Start from 0 - starts the ordered list from 0
- Remove a block - removes a block, that a player is looking at from the ordered list
- Remove all blocks - clears the ordered list

## Config
- Supports Mod/Menu and YACL
- Currently used only for toggling the ordered selected blocks highlighter

## Plans
- More customization for the block highlighter (different color, make a default for each song selected by the user upon saving)
- More compact formatting for the config file
- Make it so you can share the songs easier
- Separate the saved songs from the config file
- Switch from selected blocks to selected noteblocks (not gonna use coordinates)
- More optimized handling of events (less FPS drops)
- Make the mod more user friendly (add descriptions/tips)
- Add a keybind for adding a block in middle of the ordered list
- Add a highlight on what note you added
